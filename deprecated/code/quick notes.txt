project. now i am only focusing on the implemented 
part, the rest will be implemented later when iam 
done with enhancing the current phases, and here 
where i want your helps. i want a plot shows the 
bundery calculated in the class 
QuantileBoundaryCalculator. the current plots shows 
time line or historgram, i want new plot shows the 
clustring for one selected variable to see how the 
baundery calculation works. and iam not sure how the
 code compine clustring with Quantil, i want to see 
that in the plot, and maybe you explain that also to
 me
