    "  * `0`: normal operation (no fault)\n",
    "  * `1–20`: specific fault types\n",

    "  * Used for training (e.g., PCA baseline) or monitoring control limits\n",
    "* Files with `faultNumber` transitioning from `0` to a fault:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Simulate fault onset and progression\n",
    "  * Used for detection and classification tasks\n",

    "* Each unique `simulationRun` is one full time series (typically 500 time steps)\n",
    "* Represents an independent simulation instance\n",
    "* Used to:\n",

    "  * Separate train/test datasets\n",
    "  * Maintain time dependencies within each run\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **What Varies Across `simulationRun`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only the **random seed** is different\n",
    "* All noise and disturbances use **fixed distributions** (e.g., Gaussian)\n",
    "* Changing `simulationRun` creates different noise realizations from the same distribution\n",

    "#### 5. **Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unsupervised models: train on normal (`faultNumber == 0`) runs\n",
    "* Supervised models: train on labeled faulty runs\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Train PCA on fault-free behavior (`faultNumber == 0`) so it captures the \"normal space\" of process variability. Any significant deviation from this space in future data (from faulty runs) results in high reconstruction error (SPE), signaling an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Procedure**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Collect and Prepare Normal Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filter data**: Keep only rows where `faultNumber == 0`.\n",
    "* **Group by**: `simulationRun` to respect time order.\n",
    "* **Drop columns**: Remove `faultNumber`, `simulationRun`, and any timestamps.\n",
    "* **Concatenate** all normal runs into a single dataset.\n",
    "* **Standardize**: Apply mean-centering and scaling (e.g., z-score).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Train the PCA Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fit PCA**: On the standardized normal data only.\n",
    "* **Retain components**: Enough to capture \\~95–99% of variance.\n",

    "This gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A projection matrix $P$\n",
    "* Principal scores $T = XP$\n",
    "* Reconstruction: $\\hat{X} = TP^T$\n",
    "* Reconstruction error (SPE): $\\text{SPE} = \\| X - \\hat{X} \\|^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Establish Control Limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate SPE for the training (normal) data.\n",
    "* Fit a control limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Empirically (e.g., 99.5th percentile of normal SPEs),\n",
    "  * Or statistically (e.g., Chi-squared or Kernel density estimate).\n",
    "\n",
    "This threshold distinguishes between **expected variation** and **anomalous deviation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Apply to New (Possibly Faulty) Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standardize new samples using the training mean and std.\n",
    "* Project using PCA model.\n",
    "* Reconstruct and compute SPE.\n",
    "* Compare SPE to the control limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **SPE below threshold** → likely normal\n",
    "  * **SPE above threshold** → potential anomaly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Postprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plot SPE over time to observe fault onset points.\n",
    "* Optionally use smoothing or alarm delay mechanisms to reduce false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data is **mean-centered** (always).\n",
    "* Faults create changes in process variable relationships that PCA cannot reconstruct well.\n",
