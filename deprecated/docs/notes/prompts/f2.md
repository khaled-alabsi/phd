i want to try to develop new method for detecting anomalies
concept:

1- train autoencoder
2- the autoencoder will try to reconstruct the input data and then we will calculate the reconstruction error
3- we build deep neural network model that will be train to measure the changes in data by using the reconstruction error from the autoencoder. so the idea, we use autoencoder to teach dnn model to capture the changes in data. and also the dnn model will have memory to capture the changes over time. 
1. the final goal: autoencoder have threshold for reconstruction error to detect anomalies, where  the dnn model will help to reduce false positive by capturing the changes in data over time.

i want you firts to draft the architecture of the model and then give me the steps to implement itArchitecture of the Model:
