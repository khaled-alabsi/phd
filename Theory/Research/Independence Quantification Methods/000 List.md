Here is a comprehensive list of methods used for **independence quantification in ICA**:

### 1. **Mutual Information-Based Methods**
   - Minimization of Mutual Information
   - Joint Information Minimization

### 2. **Non-Gaussianity Maximization**
   - Kurtosis-based Methods
   - Negentropy-based Methods

### 3. **Entropy-Based Methods**
   - Joint Entropy Minimization
   - Individual Entropy Maximization
   - Total Information Minimization

### 4. **Likelihood Maximization**
   - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
   - Bayesian Approaches

### 5. **Contrast Function-Based Methods**
   - FastICA Contrast Functions:
     - Log-cosh Contrast
     - Exponential Contrast
     - Fourth-Order Cumulant Contrast
   - Generalized Contrast Functions

### 6. **Statistical Dependency Measures**
   - Higher-Order Statistical Moments
   - Cross-Correlation Minimization
   - Mutual Predictability Minimization

### 7. **Sparse Representation-Based Methods**
   - Sparse Component Analysis (SCA)
   - L1-Norm Regularization

### 8. **Information Geometry-Based Methods**
   - Divergence Minimization (e.g., Kullback-Leibler Divergence)
   - Independent Subspace Analysis

### 9. **Time-Series and Temporal Methods**
   - Temporal Independence Measures
   - Autocorrelation Reduction
   - Frequency-Domain ICA (fICA)

### 10. **Graphical and Network-Based Methods**
   - Graphical Models for Independence
   - Dependency Networks

### 11. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - Combining Entropy and Non-Gaussianity
   - Mutual Information with Sparse Representations

### 12. **Bayesian and Variational Methods**
   - Variational Bayes ICA
   - Bayesian ICA with Prior Distributions

These methods cater to different assumptions about the data (e.g., Gaussianity, sparsity, or temporal structure) and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the ICA problem.
