- The objective of this work is to detail **Multivariate Process Monitoring (MPM)**, which uses **statistical methods** and machine learning to analyze numerous correlated process variables simultaneously.
***
It aims to **detect and diagnose** a spectrum of malfunctions, including anomalies and process drifts, to maintain process stability, product quality, and operational efficiency.
***
The study addresses implementation challenges and benchmarks detection methods using key metrics like **$ARL_0$**, **$ARL_1$**, **FPR**,...  to guide practical application.
