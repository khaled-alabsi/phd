# MSPC Objective list

## Improving

- **Finde the bes Trade-offs** a tool or a methode to auto finde best fit (**sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, detection delay, interpretability, computational cost, robustness, and scalability**)
- **Benchmarking**: Standard datasets, metrics, and evaluation protocols are needed to compare methods fairly.
- **Adaptive methods**: Algorithms should evolve with the data stream.
- **Interpretable techniques**: Needed to support fault diagnosis and regulatory compliance.
