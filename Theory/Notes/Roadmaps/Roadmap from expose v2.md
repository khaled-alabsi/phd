## 📌 Phase 1 – Foundations (Year 1)

### Objectives
- Define problem space
- Map the method landscape
- Build experimental capacity

### Tasks
- Deep literature review (SPC, multivariate control charts, AI-based detection)
- Compare classic distributions (Multivariate Normal vs t, skewed, mixture models)
- Learn and test Python libraries: `pyspc`, `scikit-multiflow`, `river`, etc.
- Define baseline evaluation metrics (ARL, detection delay, TPR/FPR)
- Identify at least one industrial dataset or simulated benchmark

## 📌 Phase 2 – Method Development (Year 2)

### Objectives
- Develop early-stage methods
- Theorize about alternative modeling and smoothing

### Tasks
- Prototype new multivariate control chart based on alternative distributions
- Test kernel smoothing, Bayesian filters, or autoencoder-based smoothing
- Explore Hotelling’s $T^2$ extensions or learnable control statistics
- Validate early results on synthetic data
- Define interpretability interface: how to attribute anomaly to variables
- Write technical working paper

---

## 📌 Phase 3 – Extension & Simulation (Year 3)

### Objectives
- Generalize methods
- Build robustness & interpretability

### Tasks
- Incorporate nonparametric or machine learning techniques
- Develop interpretable layer (e.g., contribution scores)
- Extensive simulation: non-normality, drift, small shifts
- Release open-source prototype (`controlcharts-ai` or similar)
- First conference paper submission
- Mid-thesis presentation

---

## 📌 Phase 4 – Application & Dissemination (Year 4)

### Objectives
- Industrial relevance
- Start writing thesis & publications

### Tasks
- Apply methods to industrial or semi-real data
- Calibrate user-adaptable control limits
- Optimize system for low-latency detection
- Compare to standard (Shewhart, CUSUM, EWMA, NN-based detectors)
- Write at least 2 journal submissions (one theoretical, one applied)
- Attend key conferences

---

## 📌 Phase 5 – Completion (Year 5)

### Objectives
- Finalize contributions
- Deliver scientific output

### Tasks
- Final evaluation and ablation studies
- Refactor implementation and package for public use
- Finish and submit dissertation
- Final journal paper (optional benchmarking study)
- Final seminar, oral defense, network expansion
